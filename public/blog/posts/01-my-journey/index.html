                        <h1>My journey as a developer</h1>
<p>Since my young age I've been interested in computer science stuff, science and anything that had to do with creating. I did a lot of Lego for instance.</p>
<p><strong>I was around 13 years old when I first ask my father about programming.</strong> Back then I simply copied and pasted code in Visual Basic to create for example a breakout game. This interest also came from the fact that I was playing a lot of video games at the time.</p>
<p>Later on, I paid less attention to computer science to <strong>focus more on video making</strong>. Could be about video games, but I was also making videos relating school trips. I keep a very good memory of those moments because I got to present my work in front of all the parents and students.</p>
<p>After high school came the moment to decide what to do for my studies. And that was a tough choice. I had a lot of interests. But I decided to <strong>come back to my original interest to computer science</strong> hand in hand with biology. Unfortunately, things did not go as planned since I ended up doing medical studies. After this unsuccessful period, I got accepted to a <strong>computer science 2 years program called IUT</strong> in France. This was the chance for me to go back to computer science full time. Despite a difficult start, I really enjoyed this program, where I met decisive people for my career. After my internship and the end of this experience I had a 6 months break where I dedicated my time to part-time jobs, working in a startup and preparing the future.</p>
<p>Therefore, I joined a <strong>one-year apprenticeship program in the <a href="https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en">Sorbonne University</a> in Paris</strong>. With the help of the company <strong><a href="https://www.itelis.fr/">Itelis</a></strong> I learned more about <strong>DevOps</strong> and gained a lot of confidence and responsibility. This experience proved once more that using my skills in a company was much more rewarding for me. And that I also loved learning directly on the field.</p>
<p>From this point, I wanted to be enrolled in an <strong>apprenticeship engineering program</strong>. That's when I joined <strong><a href="https://www.efrei.fr/">Efrei</a> school</strong> for 3 years, being hopefully my last years as a student. This time I was aiming at a mission where I could be more involved in a team tasks, so I could be part of real use cases and projects. Hence, I joined the telecom company <strong><a href="https://www.orange.fr">Orange</a> as a DataOps engineer</strong>. A position that Iâ€™m still occupying until September 2023. This experience has been the most challenging, as I started to work on new technologies with different process and on a larger scale.</p>
<p>From all these years working with computer sciences, I can confirm that I enjoy that a lot. I remember myself as a kid, when I was crafty and curious, I feel like I got to fulfill those needs with my jobs and personal projects. For me, <strong>coding is really about creating something useful for others and meaningful to me</strong>. Something fun where I can <strong>express myself and spend hours trying to solve problems or try new technologies</strong>. Computer science made me explore a lot of areas and meet incredible people, therefore I intend to continue my journey as a developer.</p>
