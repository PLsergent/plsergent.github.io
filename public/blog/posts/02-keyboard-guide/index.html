<h2 id="%E2%9D%94why%3F" tabindex="-1">❔Why? <a class="direct-link" href="#%E2%9D%94why%3F">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Mechanical keyboards have been around for a while now. Starting from the 80s, with a famous keyboard: the IBM model M.</p>
<img src="/static/img/posts-img/keyboard-guide/IBM_Model_M.png" alt="ibm-model-m" width="55%"/>
<p><em>IBM model M</em></p>
<p>Even today people are nostalgic about this keyboard and still use it: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/11/why-i-use-a-20-year-old-ibm-model-m-keyboard/">Why I use a 20-year-old IBM Model M keyboard</a>, but why?</p>
<p>The main reason is the <strong>feel</strong> of the keyboard. Mechanical keyboards are <strong>more tactile</strong> and <strong>more responsive</strong> than membrane keyboards. The keys are <strong>more solid</strong> and <strong>more durable</strong>. The <strong>sound</strong> is also different, it's more <strong>clicky</strong> and <strong>loud</strong>.</p>
<p>Nowadays, mechanical keyboards are also widespread but mainly in the gaming community. And if you don't like flashy RGB, with questionable design choices, it's hard to see yourself using a mechanical keyboard, especially if you're not a gamer. That's why most people won't pay attention to mechanical keyboards and prefer to use membrane/butterfly keyboards, also because they don't care about having a great keyboard right? But those who are using their keyboards daily don't know what they're missing, because having a mechanical keyboard with a nice design is possible.</p>
<p>I got into this hobby about 3 years ago, when <strong>I was stuck between having to use a membrane Dell keyboard and a flashy and loud gamer mechanical keyboard</strong>. I was looking for something in between, and <strong>I found it</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>TLDR;</strong></em> If you are stuck between a membrane keyboard and a gamer mechanical keyboard, you should consider a custom mechanical keyboard especially if you use a keyboard daily. I'll list the reasons below.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="%F0%9F%94%9Dthe-design" tabindex="-1">🔝The design <a class="direct-link" href="#%F0%9F%94%9Dthe-design">🔗</a></h3>
<p><strong>Designs</strong> of custom mechanical keyboards (keebs) are <strong>wide and varied</strong>. As the name suggests you can do anything you want, <strong>find your style</strong>, and make it your own. But if you search online, you'll find out that most custom keebs are <strong>very neat and clean</strong>. The aesthetic is very important for the community, and it's a big part of the hobby. You can find a lot of inspiration on <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">r/mechanicalkeyboards</a></strong>.</p>
<p>That's one of the things that inspired me, I felt like the keebs were fitting my style more than the gamer ones without being a membrane cheap keyboard. It becomes more than just a keyboard, it's a <strong>piece of art</strong>.</p>

<p><em><strong>TLDR;</strong></em> Keebs are beautiful, elegant and clean. They are a piece of art, and they can fit your style.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="%F0%9F%94%9Dthe-feel" tabindex="-1">🔝The feel <a class="direct-link" href="#%F0%9F%94%9Dthe-feel">🔗</a></h3>
<p><strong>The feel</strong> of a custom mechanical keyboard is <strong>very different</strong> from a membrane or laptop keyboard. Most people prefer when the keys are low profile, but the feeling you get from a good keeb is unmatched.</p>
<p>The main reason is that you're getting a more pronounced <strong>tactile feedback</strong>. This has been made possible by the <strong>switches</strong>. They give a less <em>mushy</em> feel, every keypress can be clearly felt, making them perfect for precise and accurate typing. It's also more satisfying to type on, thanks to the switches.</p>
<p>Cherry is one of the pioneers in the domain. If you want to know more about the history of switches you can read <a href="https://tedium.co/2018/07/19/cherry-mx-keyboard-history/">this article</a> and <a href="https://keyboardsexpert.com/history-of-mechanical-keyboard-switches/">this article</a>. Cherry designed his first switch in the '60s and received a patent in 1974. The first Cherry MX switch was released in 1984. The MX switch is still used today, and it's the most popular switch in the mechanical keyboard community.</p>

<p><em><strong>TLDR;</strong></em> The feel of a keeb is very different from a membrane or laptop keyboard. It's more tactile and responsive, and it's perfect for precise and accurate typing. It's also more satisfying to type on, thanks to the switches.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="%F0%9F%94%9Dthe-sound" tabindex="-1">🔝The sound <a class="direct-link" href="#%F0%9F%94%9Dthe-sound">🔗</a></h3>
<p><strong>The sound</strong> of a keeb is what stands out the most in my opinion. It's louder than a membrane/butterfly keyboard, but it's not as loud as a gamer mechanical keyboard. It's also a more <strong>precise</strong> and <strong>satisfying</strong> sound, without the plastic feels that other keyboards can have.</p>
<p>You can customize the sound by <strong>choosing the switches</strong>, <strong>adding foam dampeners</strong>, <strong>o-rings</strong>, <strong>keycaps</strong>, etc. You can also lube the switches, we'll talk about that later.</p>
<p>You can be team <strong>thocky</strong>, team <strong>clacky</strong>, or team <strong>clicky</strong>. It's all about personal preference, and you can the sound that satisfies you the most.</p>
<p>In the <strong>first video</strong> below, you can see an example of a great keeb sound. The second video helps us remind that a keyboard sound <strong>depends on a lot of factors</strong> and the sound you hear in the video might not be representative of reality.</p>

<p><em><strong>TLDR;</strong></em> The sound of a keeb is very satisfying, and you can customize it by choosing the switches, adding foam dampeners, o-rings, keycaps, etc.</p>

<h3 id="%F0%9F%94%9Dthe-customization" tabindex="-1">🔝The customization <a class="direct-link" href="#%F0%9F%94%9Dthe-customization">🔗</a></h3>
<p>This is the main reason <strong>most people</strong> could get into this hobby, or even make one keeb. <strong>You can customize everything</strong>. You can choose the <strong>switches</strong>, the <strong>keycaps</strong>, the <strong>cable</strong>, the <strong>plate</strong>, the <strong>case</strong>, the <strong>PCB</strong>, the <strong>stabilizers</strong>, the <strong>dampeners</strong>, the <strong>LEDs</strong>, the <strong>lube</strong>, etc. Most of the time a keyboard kit will come with the essential parts (PCB, plate, case).</p>
<p>You can create something <strong>unique</strong> in terms of design, sound, feel, and even weight. You can also <strong>choose the layout</strong> (more on that later), and <strong>add layers</strong>. You can also <strong>program macros</strong> and <strong>remap keys</strong> (using <a href="https://www.caniusevia.com/">VIA</a> or <a href="https://config.qmk.fm/">QMK configurator</a>).</p>
<p>This ability to customize everything is what makes the hobby so <strong>interesting</strong> and <strong>addicting</strong>. You can <strong>create something unique</strong> that fits your style and your needs. But it can also be <em>overwhelming</em>, with a <strong>lot of options</strong> and a <strong>lot of things to learn</strong>.</p>

<p>While I was writing this guide I came across this awesome website <strong><a href="https://keyboard.university/">keyboard university</a></strong>. It's a great resource for beginners, and it's a great place to start. I'll try to cover the most important things in this guide, but I highly recommend you check out the website.

<h3 id="gather-information" tabindex="-1">Gather information <a class="direct-link" href="#gather-information">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The first crucial step of your journey to becoming a <strong>keeb enthusiast</strong> (or if you want to build just one keyboard) is to <strong>gather information</strong> by scrolling through social media, forums, videos, vendors' websites, etc. One of the great resources is the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/">r/mechanicalkeyboards</a> subreddit.</p>
<p>I'll list some of the resources in other sections of this guide:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#%F0%9F%9B%8D%EF%B8%8Fwhere-to-buy%3F">vendors</a></li>
<li><a href="#%F0%9F%93%B7cool-content-creators">cool content creators</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can also go on the forum <a href="https://geekhack.org/">geekhack</a>. It's a great resource, but it can be overwhelming at first.</p>
<h3 id="master-the-vocabulary" tabindex="-1">Master the vocabulary <a class="direct-link" href="#master-the-vocabulary">🔗</a></h3>
<p>The keeb community has its vocabulary. You'll need to learn it to understand what people are talking about. Here are some of the most important terms:</p>
<p><strong>About keyboard itself</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Case</strong> - the part of the keyboard that holds the plate and the PCB.</li>
<li><strong>Dampeners</strong> - the part of the keyboard that reduces the sound of the switches. They can be foam, o-rings, or springs.</li>
<li><strong>Firmware</strong> - the software that runs on the keyboard. It's usually open source, and you can customize it (most of the time it's gonna be QMK).</li>
<li><strong>Gasket mount</strong> - a way to mount the PCB to the case. It's usually done with rubber gaskets.</li>
<li><strong>Hotswap PCB</strong> - PCB that allows you to mount switches without soldering.</li>
<li><strong>Keycaps</strong> - the part of the keyboard that you press. They come in different shapes, sizes, and colors.</li>
<li><strong>LEDs</strong> - the part of the keyboard that lights up the keycaps. They can be RGB, single color, or even no LEDs.</li>
<li><strong>Layout</strong> - literally the layout of the keyboard. It can be 60%, 65%, 75%, 80%, 90%, 100%, TKL, 1800, 1900, etc. (more on that later), there is also a distinction between ANSI and ISO layouts.</li>
<li><strong>Mounting style</strong> - how the plate or PCB is secured in the keyboard housing. (more on that here: <a href="https://www.keyboard.university/200-courses/keyboard-mounting-styles-4lpp7">keyboard-university</a>)</li>
<li><strong>PCB</strong> - the part of the keyboard that holds the switches and the diodes. It's also where the microcontroller is.</li>
<li><strong>Plate</strong> - the part of the keyboard that holds the switches and the keycaps. It can be made of different materials (aluminum, FR4, polycarbonate, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Solder PCB</strong> - PCB that requires you to solder the switches to the PCB. Then, you can't remove the switches (unless you desolder them).</li>
<li><strong>Stabilizers</strong> - the part of the keyboard that holds the keycaps in place. They are used for the spacebar, the shift keys and the enter.</li>
<li><strong>Switches</strong> - the part of the keyboard that registers the keypresses. There are a lot of different types of switches, and they all have different characteristics.</li>
<li><strong>Weight</strong> - the part of the keyboard that goes underneath the case.</li>

<p><strong>About the switches</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actuation force</strong> - the force needed to press the switch to register the key press.</li>
<li><strong>Actuation</strong> - the distance you need to press the switch to register the key press.</li>
<li><strong>Bottom housing</strong> - the part of the switch that goes on the bottom.</li>
<li><strong>Bottoming out</strong> - the distance you need to press the switch to bottom out.</li>
<li><strong>Bump</strong> - the switch that has a bump. It can be tactile or clicky, linear switches don't have a bump.</li>
<li><strong>Clacky</strong> - the switch that has a clacky sound (the sound also depends on other factors).</li>
<li><strong>Clicky</strong> - the switch that has a tactile bump and a clicky sound. (ex: Gateron Blue)</li>
<li><strong>Filming</strong> - the process of applying a film to the switch. It goes between the top and bottom housing. It helps reduce unwanted noise from the switch.</li>
<li><strong>Linear</strong> - the switch that has a smooth and linear feel. (ex: Gateron Yellow)</li>
<li><strong>Lube</strong> - the substance that is applied to the switch to make it feel and sound better.</li>
<li><strong>Lubing</strong> - the process of applying lube to the switch.</li>
<li><strong>Posttravel</strong> - the distance you need to press the switch after it registers the keypress.</li>
<li><strong>Pretravel</strong> - the distance you need to press the switch before it registers the keypress.</li>
<li><strong>Spring</strong> - the part of the switch that determines the force needed to press the switch. Placed between the stem and the bottom housing.</li>
<li><strong>Stem</strong> - the part of the switch that goes between the top and bottom housing, and the spring.</li>
<li><strong>Tactile</strong> - the switch that has a tactile bump. (ex: Gateron Brown)</li>
<li><strong>Thocky</strong> - the switch that has a thocky sound (the sound also depends on other factors).</li>
<li><strong>Top housing</strong> - the part of the switch that goes on top.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>About the keycaps</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ABS</strong> - the keycap that has an <strong>ABS material</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Double shot</strong> - the keycap that has been shot twice, once for the legends and once for the color. Usually means that it's better quality, for both the durability and the legends.</li>
<li><strong>Dye sub</strong> - the process of printing the legends on the keycap. There are a lot of different methods, the most common one is <strong>dye sublimation</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>GMK</strong> - is a very famous keycaps manufacturer. They have a lot of different keycap sets, and they are known for their high quality. But usually, you have to wait a lot of time to get your hands on them.</li>
<li><strong>Keycap set</strong> - the set of keycaps that have the same color (actually depends but you got it), material, and profile.</li>
<li><strong>Keycap width</strong> - the width of the keycap expressed in a unit <em>U</em>, which represents the width of a standard alpha keycap (keycap with a letter on it).</li>
<li><strong>Material</strong> - the material of the keycap. There are a lot of different materials, the most common one is <strong>PBT</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>PBT</strong> - the keycap that has a <strong>PBT material</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Profile</strong> - the shape of the keycap. There are a lot of different profiles, the most common one is the <strong>cherry profile</strong>. Pretty much all the keycaps can fit on a standard switch (with the cherry specification).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>About the hobby in general</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deskmat</strong> - a mat that goes on your desk. Can be used for design, comfort, or sound purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Foam</strong> - a material that is used to dampen the sound of the keyboard. Usually, it's used on the bottom of the keyboard.</li>
<li><strong>Group buy</strong> - process to buy keebs related products where you pay upfront, and then the manufacturer will produce the product. Usually, you have to wait a lot of time, around 6 months to 1 year (sometimes up to 2 years for GMK sets). <strong>This is probably the most important thing you need to know about the hobby</strong>. If you want high-end/interesting products you'll have to do group buys. You can always buy cheaper things that are in stock, but you'll miss out on a lot of cool stuff (although buying an affordable in-stock keyboard can be a good idea at first to learn about the building mechanism and not all in-stock keebs are bad of course).</li>
<li><strong>Interest check</strong> - a poll to see if there is enough interest in a product. Usually, it's used before a group buy to see if it is worth starting it. Watching for interest checks is a good way to know what products are coming out soon, and you can also support people that are trying to launch their products. You can find interest checks on <a href="https://geekhack.org/index.php?board=132.0">geekhack</a> and on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/search/?q=IC&amp;restrict_sr=1&amp;sr_nsfw=&amp;include_over_18=1&amp;sort=new">r/mechanicalkeyboards</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Keeb enthusiast</strong> - a person who is passionate about keyboards.</li>
<li><strong>Keeb</strong> - a keyboard.</li>
<li><strong>QMK</strong> - firmware that allows you to customize your keyboard. You can find it in most of the keyboards you'll find in the hobby. You can customize the firmware on tools like <a href="https://config.qmk.fm/#/">QMK Configurator</a> or <a href="https://caniusevia.com/">VIA</a>. <strong>For beginners, I recommend using VIA, it's easier to use.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Sound test</strong> - a video that shows the sound of a keyboard. Usually, it's just a video of someone typing showcasing the result that he achieved.</li>
<li><strong>VIA</strong> - free software that allows you to customize your keyboard. You can remap the keys directly on the firmware, meaning if you take your keyboard to another computer the changes will remain.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><em><strong>TLDR;</strong></em> You don't have to know everything, especially if you're looking to build just one keyboard. Just remember that the most beautiful keyboards that you can find will require that you participate in group buys.
