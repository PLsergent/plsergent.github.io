<ul>
<li><strong>Case</strong> - the part of the keyboard that holds the plate and the PCB.</li>
<li><strong>Dampeners</strong> - the part of the keyboard that reduces the sound of the switches. They can be foam, o-rings, or springs.</li>
<li><strong>Firmware</strong> - the software that runs on the keyboard. It's usually open source, and you can customize it (most of the time it's gonna be QMK).</li>
<li><strong>Gasket mount</strong> - a way to mount the PCB to the case. It's usually done with rubber gaskets.</li>
<li><strong>Hotswap PCB</strong> - PCB that allows you to mount switches without soldering.</li>
<li><strong>Keycaps</strong> - the part of the keyboard that you press. They come in different shapes, sizes, and colors.</li>
<li><strong>LEDs</strong> - the part of the keyboard that lights up the keycaps. They can be RGB, single color, or even no LEDs.</li>
<li><strong>Layout</strong> - literally the layout of the keyboard. It can be 60%, 65%, 75%, 80%, 90%, 100%, TKL, 1800, 1900, etc. (more on that later), there is also a distinction between ANSI and ISO layouts.</li>
<li><strong>Mounting style</strong> - how the plate or PCB is secured in the keyboard housing. (more on that here: <a href="https://www.keyboard.university/200-courses/keyboard-mounting-styles-4lpp7">keyboard-university</a>)</li>
<li><strong>PCB</strong> - the part of the keyboard that holds the switches and the diodes. It's also where the microcontroller is.</li>
<li><strong>Plate</strong> - the part of the keyboard that holds the switches and the keycaps. It can be made of different materials (aluminum, FR4, polycarbonate, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Solder PCB</strong> - PCB that requires you to solder the switches to the PCB. Then, you can't remove the switches (unless you desolder them).</li>
<li><strong>Stabilizers</strong> - the part of the keyboard that holds the keycaps in place. They are used for the spacebar, the shift keys and the enter.</li>
<li><strong>Switches</strong> - the part of the keyboard that registers the keypresses. There are a lot of different types of switches, and they all have different characteristics.</li>
<li><strong>Weight</strong> - the part of the keyboard that goes underneath the case.</li>
</ul>
