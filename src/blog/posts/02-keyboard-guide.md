## ‚ùîWhy?
Mechanical keyboards have been around for a while now. Starting from the 80s, with a famous keyboard: the IBM model M.

Even today people are nostalgic about this keyboard and still use it: [Why I use a 20-year-old IBM Model M keyboard](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/11/why-i-use-a-20-year-old-ibm-model-m-keyboard/), but why?

The main reason is the **feel** of the keyboard. Mechanical keyboards are **more tactile** and **more responsive** than membrane keyboards. The keys are **more solid** and **more durable**. The **sound** is also different, it's more **clicky** and **loud**.

Nowadays, mechanical keyboards are also widespread but mainly in the gaming community. And if you don't like flashy RGB, with questionable design choices, it's hard to see yourself using a mechanical keyboard, especially if you're not a gamer. That's why most people won't pay attention to mechanical keyboards and prefer to use membrane/butterfly keyboards, also because they don't care about having a great keyboard right? But those who are using their keyboards daily don't know what they're missing, because having a mechanical keyboard with a nice design is possible.

I got into this hobby about 3 years ago, when **I was stuck between having to use a membrane Dell keyboard and a flashy and loud gamer mechanical keyboard**. I was looking for something in between, and **I found it**.

***TLDR;*** If you are stuck between a membrane keyboard and a gamer mechanical keyboard, you should consider a custom mechanical keyboard especially if you use a keyboard daily. I'll list the reasons below.

---

### üîùThe design

**Designs** of custom mechanical keyboards (keebs) are **wide and varied**. As the name suggests you can do anything you want, **find your style**, and make it your own. But if you search online, you'll find out that most custom keebs are **very neat and clean**. The aesthetic is very important for the community, and it's a big part of the hobby. You can find a lot of inspiration on **[r/mechanicalkeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/)**.

That's one of the things that inspired me, I felt like the keebs were fitting my style more than the gamer ones without being a membrane cheap keyboard. It becomes more than just a keyboard, it's a **piece of art**.

***TLDR;*** Keebs are beautiful, elegant and clean. They are a piece of art, and they can fit your style.

### üîùThe feel

**The feel** of a custom mechanical keyboard is **very different** from a membrane or laptop keyboard. Most people prefer when the keys are low profile, but the feeling you get from a good keeb is unmatched.

The main reason is that you're getting a more pronounced **tactile feedback**. This has been made possible by the **switches**. They give a less *mushy* feel, every keypress can be clearly felt, making them perfect for precise and accurate typing. It's also more satisfying to type on, thanks to the switches.

Cherry is one of the pioneers in the domain. If you want to know more about the history of switches you can read [this article](https://tedium.co/2018/07/19/cherry-mx-keyboard-history/) and [this article](https://keyboardsexpert.com/history-of-mechanical-keyboard-switches/). Cherry designed his first switch in the '60s and received a patent in 1974. The first Cherry MX switch was released in 1984. The MX switch is still used today, and it's the most popular switch in the mechanical keyboard community.

### üîùThe sound

**The sound** of a keeb is what stands out the most in my opinion. It's louder than a membrane/butterfly keyboard, but it's not as loud as a gamer mechanical keyboard. It's also a more **precise** and **satisfying** sound, without the plastic feels that other keyboards can have.

You can customize the sound by **choosing the switches**, **adding foam dampeners**, **o-rings**, **keycaps**, etc. You can also lube the switches, we'll talk about that later.

You can be team **thocky**, team **clacky**, or team **clicky**. It's all about personal preference, and you can the sound that satisfies you the most.

In the **first video** below, you can see an example of a great keeb sound. The second video helps us remind that a keyboard sound **depends on a lot of factors** and the sound you hear in the video might not be representative of reality.

### üîùThe customization

This is the main reason **most people** could get into this hobby, or even make one keeb. **You can customize everything**. You can choose the **switches**, the **keycaps**, the **cable**, the **plate**, the **case**, the **PCB**, the **stabilizers**, the **dampeners**, the **LEDs**, the **lube**, etc. Most of the time a keyboard kit will come with the essential parts (PCB, plate, case).

You can create something **unique** in terms of design, sound, feel, and even weight. You can also **choose the layout** (more on that later), and **add layers**. You can also **program macros** and **remap keys** (using [VIA](https://www.caniusevia.com/) or [QMK configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/)).

This ability to customize everything is what makes the hobby so **interesting** and **addicting**. You can **create something unique** that fits your style and your needs. But it can also be *overwhelming*, with a **lot of options** and a **lot of things to learn**.

This is why I'm writing this guide, to help you get started.

## üîúWhere to start?

### Learn the basics - [keyboard university](https://keyboard.university/)

While I was writing this guide I came across this awesome website **[keyboard university](https://keyboard.university/)**. It's a great resource for beginners, and it's a great place to start. I'll try to cover the most important things in this guide, but I highly recommend you check out the website. (Brought to you by [thekey.company](https://thekey.company/))

### Gather information

The first crucial step of your journey to becoming a **keeb enthusiast** (or if you want to build just one keyboard) is to **gather information** by scrolling through social media, forums, videos, vendors' websites, etc. One of the great resources is the [r/mechanicalkeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) subreddit.

I'll list some of the resources in other sections of this guide:
- [vendors](#üõç%EF%B8%8Fwhere-to-buy%3F)
- [cool content creators](#üì∑cool-content-creators)

You can also go on the forum [geekhack](https://geekhack.org/). It's a great resource, but it can be overwhelming at first.

### Master the vocabulary

The keeb community has its vocabulary. You'll need to learn it to understand what people are talking about. Here are some of the most important terms:

**About keyboard itself**

**About the hobby in general**

---
***TLDR;*** You don't have to know everything, especially if you're looking to build just one keyboard. Just remember that the most beautiful keyboards that you can find will require that you participate in group buys.

## üí∞What to buy?

You're ready to buy your first keyboard? Good! But first, you need to know what you want. There are a lot of different keyboards, and you need to know what you want to buy. Here are some questions that you need to ask yourself:
- What is your budget?
- How long are you willing to wait?
- What layout do you want?
- What is your switch preference?
- What is your keycap design/profile preference?
- Do I want a prebuilt or a DIY keyboard?
