## ‚ùîWhy?
Mechanical keyboards have been around for a while now. Starting from the 80s, with a famous keyboard: the IBM model M.

*IBM model M*

Even today people are nostalgic about this keyboard and still use it: [Why I use a 20-year-old IBM Model M keyboard](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/11/why-i-use-a-20-year-old-ibm-model-m-keyboard/), but why?

The main reason is the **feel** of the keyboard. Mechanical keyboards are **more tactile** and **more responsive** than membrane keyboards. The keys are **more solid** and **more durable**. The **sound** is also different, it's more **clicky** and **loud**.

Nowadays, mechanical keyboards are also widespread but mainly in the gaming community. And if you don't like flashy RGB, with questionable design choices, it's hard to see yourself using a mechanical keyboard, especially if you're not a gamer. That's why most people won't pay attention to mechanical keyboards and prefer to use membrane/butterfly keyboards, also because they don't care about having a great keyboard right? But those who are using their keyboards daily don't know what they're missing, because having a mechanical keyboard with a nice design is possible.

I got into this hobby about 3 years ago, when **I was stuck between having to use a membrane Dell keyboard and a flashy and loud gamer mechanical keyboard**. I was looking for something in between, and **I found it**.

---
***TLDR; üè∑Ô∏è*** If you are stuck between a membrane keyboard and a gamer mechanical keyboard, you should consider a custom mechanical keyboard especially if you use a keyboard daily. I'll list the reasons below.

---

### üîùThe design

**Designs** of custom mechanical keyboards (keebs) are **wide and varied**. As the name suggests you can do anything you want, **find your style**, and make it your own. But if you search online, you'll find out that most custom keebs are **very neat and clean**. The aesthetic is very important for the community, and it's a big part of the hobby. You can find a lot of inspiration on **[r/mechanicalkeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/)**.

That's one of the things that inspired me, I felt like the keebs were fitting my style more than the gamer ones without being a membrane cheap keyboard. It becomes more than just a keyboard, it's a **piece of art**.

***TLDR; üè∑Ô∏è*** Keebs are beautiful, elegant and clean. They are a piece of art, and they can fit your style.

---

### üîùThe feel

**The feel** of a custom mechanical keyboard is **very different** from a membrane or laptop keyboard. Most people prefer when the keys are low profile, but the feeling you get from a good keeb is unmatched.

The main reason is that you're getting a more pronounced **tactile feedback**. This has been made possible by the **switches**. They give a less *mushy* feel, every keypress can be clearly felt, making them perfect for precise and accurate typing. It's also more satisfying to type on, thanks to the switches.

Cherry is one of the pioneers in the domain. If you want to know more about the history of switches you can read [this article](https://tedium.co/2018/07/19/cherry-mx-keyboard-history/) and [this article](https://keyboardsexpert.com/history-of-mechanical-keyboard-switches/). Cherry designed his first switch in the '60s and received a patent in 1974. The first Cherry MX switch was released in 1984. The MX switch is still used today, and it's the most popular switch in the mechanical keyboard community.

---

### üîùThe sound

**The sound** of a keeb is what stands out the most in my opinion. It's louder than a membrane/butterfly keyboard, but it's not as loud as a gamer mechanical keyboard. It's also a more **precise** and **satisfying** sound, without the plastic feels that other keyboards can have.

You can customize the sound by **choosing the switches**, **adding foam dampeners**, **o-rings**, **keycaps**, etc. You can also lube the switches, we'll talk about that later.

You can be team **thocky**, team **clacky**, or team **clicky**. It's all about personal preference, and you can the sound that satisfies you the most.

In the **first video** below, you can see an example of a great keeb sound. The second video helps us remind that a keyboard sound **depends on a lot of factors** and the sound you hear in the video might not be representative of reality.

***TLDR; üè∑Ô∏è*** The sound of a keeb is very satisfying, and you can customize it by choosing the switches, adding foam dampeners, o-rings, keycaps, etc.

---

### üîùThe customization

This is the main reason **most people** could get into this hobby, or even make one keeb. **You can customize everything**. You can choose the **switches**, the **keycaps**, the **cable**, the **plate**, the **case**, the **PCB**, the **stabilizers**, the **dampeners**, the **LEDs**, the **lube**, etc. Most of the time a keyboard kit will come with the essential parts (PCB, plate, case).

You can create something **unique** in terms of design, sound, feel, and even weight. You can also **choose the layout** (more on that later), and **add layers**. You can also **program macros** and **remap keys** (using [VIA](https://www.caniusevia.com/) or [QMK configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/)).

This ability to customize everything is what makes the hobby so **interesting** and **addicting**. You can **create something unique** that fits your style and your needs. But it can also be *overwhelming*, with a **lot of options** and a **lot of things to learn**.

This is why I'm writing this guide, to help you get started.

## üîúWhere to start?

### Learn the basics - [keyboard university](https://keyboard.university/)

While I was writing this guide I came across this awesome website **[keyboard university](https://keyboard.university/)**. It's a great resource for beginners, and it's a great place to start. I'll try to cover the most important things in this guide, but I highly recommend you check out the website. (Brought to you by [thekey.company](https://thekey.company/))

### Gather information

The first crucial step of your journey to becoming a **keeb enthusiast** (or if you want to build just one keyboard) is to **gather information** by scrolling through social media, forums, videos, vendors' websites, etc. One of the great resources is the [r/mechanicalkeyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) subreddit.

I'll list some of the resources in other sections of this guide:
- [vendors](#üõç%EF%B8%8Fwhere-to-buy%3F)
- [cool content creators](#üì∑cool-content-creators)

You can also go on the forum [geekhack](https://geekhack.org/). It's a great resource, but it can be overwhelming at first.

### Master the vocabulary

The keeb community has its vocabulary. You'll need to learn it to understand what people are talking about. Here are some of the most important terms:

**About keyboard itself**

## üí∞What to buy?

You're ready to buy your first keyboard? Good! But first, you need to know what you want. There are a lot of options out there and you need to know what you're aiming for. Here are some questions that you need to ask yourself:
- What is your budget?
- How long are you willing to wait?
- What layout do you want?
- Hot-swappable or soldered?
- What is your switch preference?
- What is your keycap design/profile preference?
- Do I want a prebuilt or a DIY keyboard?
...

I'll try to answer these questions in the following sections. But again, you'll have to do your research.

### Budget

There is a **large scale of prices** for keyboards. Of course, if you want to get into the hobby and get a real custom keyboard there is some cost involved outside of the keyboard itself. You'll need to buy **switches**, **keycaps**, **cables**, **tools**, etc. But you can also get a good keyboard for a reasonable price (reasonable being a relative term). 

**Tools** ~= **20‚Ç¨ to 75‚Ç¨** - [Tools](#tools)

**Switches** ~= **30‚Ç¨ to 70‚Ç¨** - [Switches](#switches), also depend on the size of the board you want to build (60%, 65%, 75%, 80%, 90%, 100%)

**Keycaps** ~= **20‚Ç¨ to 150‚Ç¨** - [Keycaps](#keycaps), hopefully, there are a lot of options around 50 to 100‚Ç¨, this is the range I would recommend since below 50‚Ç¨ the quality is usually pretty poor.

**Extras** ~= **0‚Ç¨ to 100‚Ç¨** - You can also get some fancy desk mats or other accessories. I would recommend getting a decent cable (25‚Ç¨) but you can also use the USB-C cable that you have at home (**pretty much all wired keyboards are gonna use USBC**).

**Keyboard itself** ~= **50‚Ç¨ to ‚ôæÔ∏è** - Usually includes the case, plate, PCB, stabilizers and foam pads, **excluding** switches, keycaps, cables, and tools. Different ranges are described below.

<details>
  <summary><h4 style='display: inline'>50‚Ç¨ to 150‚Ç¨ - Beginner/first keyboard, usually poor to okay quality</h4></summary>

That's a dangerous price range because you can find decent boards but also pretty bad things. A lot of the time the keebs will be **prebuilt** (meaning no need to buy other parts). Those keyboards are **mainly built of plastic**. But there is some well know brand like [Keychron](https://www.keychron.com/) that offers some decent boards at this price range. If you go for that I would highly recommend that you still open up the board to perform some modding.

There are still some options available on [Aliexpress](https://fr.aliexpress.com/) (rg61, tm680, Epomaker, bm65rgb, etc) that I don't particularly recommend.

As well as other vendors, here is a quick list of some options: Anne pro 2, Ducky, Varmilo, Leopold, D60Lite üëç, etc.

***This price range is the one I would recommend for a first keyboard or if you're a beginner in the hobby.***

***TLDR; üè∑Ô∏è*** Good for beginners. You can get a decent keyboard for a reasonable price. But you'll need to do some research.

</details>

<br>

<details>
  <summary><h4 style='display: inline'>150‚Ç¨ to 350‚Ç¨ - Intermediate/advanced, can't go wrong here</h4></summary>

You got your first custom keeb but now you want to go further (or maybe you're just rich)? Okay, this price range is perfect for intermediate/advanced keebs. Most of the well-known group buys will be in this range (QK, Zoom65, Tofu, KBD67, Modekeyboards, etc).

You'll be able to find a **lot of options** with **high quality** overall and **interesting designs**. The board will be made of **aluminum**, **brass** or **polycarbonate**. It will last longer, be more durable and most importantly, it will look better and cleaner. For instance, white plastic tends to become yellowish over time, but aluminum will stay white.

This price range is where you'll find most of the interesting boards on the market. Keep in mind that it's going to require you to join group buys and wait for the board to be produced. But it's worth it.

This might sound like a lot of money but if we compare it to gaming keyboards, some of them can cost up to 300‚Ç¨. In my opinion, a custom keyboard is a lot more interesting, beautiful, and high-standard, you can get a lot more out of it.

***TLDR; üè∑Ô∏è*** Good for intermediate/advanced users. High standard, and beautiful boards. A lot of options. But you'll need to join group buys.

</details>

<br>

<details>
  <summary><h4 style='display: inline'>350‚Ç¨ to ‚ôæÔ∏è - Veteran, to the moon, you can get anything</h4></summary>

At this point, you either have a lot of money or you're a veteran in the hobby. For this price point, you can get pretty much anything you want. **Crazy design**, **advanced features**, and **very high-quality/design**.

Is it worth it to spend that much money on a keyboard? **Probably not**. But as with all hobbies, it's a matter of taste and what you want to do. If you want to get into the hobby and you're willing to spend that much money, go for it. But if you're just looking for a keyboard, you can get a lot of good options for a lot less.

At this point, you want to push the customization to the max and have a really unique board.

***TLDR; üè∑Ô∏è*** Good for veterans. Crazy design, advanced features, and very high-quality/design. But probably not worth it, unless you fell in love with a specific board.

</details>

### Wait time

Depending on the type of purchase you're doing you might experience some noticeable wait time. Here is a quick list of the different types of purchases and their wait time.

#### Groups buys

This is the most common way to get interesting stuff in the hobby. Group buys usually **last a week or two**, and at the end of this period, the vendor will pass the order to the manufacturer. The manufacturer will then produce the boards and send them to the vendor. The vendor will then ship the items to the customers. This process can take at least **4-5 months**, sometimes up to **a year or two**. Note that the vendors in your region are not the ones who designed the items, they are just the middleman between you and the manufacturer.

Recap of the process (from the customer's perspective):
- **Interest check \[IC\]**: the designer of the items (board, keycaps, desk mat, etc) will post a thread on Reddit or other platforms to see if there is enough interest in the product. If there is enough interest, the designer will move on to the next step.
- **Group buy \[GB\]**: the designer will contact vendors in various regions (note that each region has its own vendors) and will ask them to host the group buy. The vendors will then post the group buy on their websites and start collecting orders. The group buy will last a week or two, and at the end of this period, if there are enough orders, the vendor will pass the order to the manufacturer, otherwise, the group buy will be canceled and the vendor will refund the customers.
- **Waiting time**: the manufacturer gets the orders and produces the number of boards that are needed. The manufacturer will then send the boards to the vendors (usually by boat). This process can take at least 4-5 months, sometimes up to a year or two.
- **Shipping**: the vendor will ship the boards to the customers. This process can take a few days to a few weeks depending on the region.

As you can see the waiting time can be quite long. You need to know what you're getting yourself into because you're committing to a long-term project. What I recommend is that if you see a board that you are really interested in, you should join the group buy and in the meanwhile you can still order other boards that are in stock.

<img src="/static/img/posts-img/keyboard-guide/geekhack.png" alt="geekhack" width="100%"/>

*You can find all the information about IC and incoming GB on [geekhack](https://geekhack.org/)*

#### Pre-order

This is a bit different from group buys since this time the vendor will start manufacturing the boards **independently from the number of orders**. You're paying for a product that is not available yet but **the production might already have started**. Items that are in pre-order **will be in-stock** if the number of pre-orders did not exceed the expected stock. Meaning that in this scenario the vendor takes the risk of having too many boards. Usually, the vendor will give you a discount if you pre-order the item.

The waiting time in this case will vary depending on the progress of the production, the region, the shipping method, etc. But it will be much shorter than group buys. Still, count on at least a few months.

#### In stock

If think you know where it's about to go. In-stock items are ready to be shipped. You can get them right away, although if you're ordering products from a different continent you might have to wait a few weeks.

### Layout

When we talk about layouts it actually refers to two things: the **size** of the keyboard and the **positioning** of the keys.

The size of the keyboard is measured in **percentage**. The most common sizes are 60%, 65%, 75%, and 100%.

For the positioning of the keys, there are two main layouts: **ANSI** and **ISO**.

#### ANSI vs ISO

**ANSI** and **ISO** are abbreviations for two global standardization organizations - American National Standards Institute and International Organization for Standardization, respectively. These acronyms refer to keyboard layouts that specify the location and size of keys, distinct from logical layouts like QWERTY, Dvorak, Colemak, etc. ANSI and ISO keyboards vary in the arrangement of the Enter, Backslash, and Left Shift keys.

<img src="/static/img/posts-img/keyboard-guide/ansi_iso.png" alt="ansi_vs_iso" width="50%"/>

*ANSI vs ISO layouts*

**In the hobby**, you'll generally find **ANSI** layouts. **ISO** layouts are also not uncommon, but most of the time you'll have to use **solder PCBs**. Why's that? Because, since the ANSI layout is **more common**, the PCB is mostly designed for it. Also since **hotswap PCBs** use **sockets** they are less permissive because you have **less space on the PCB**. Where soldering PCBs **only require holes** (and no sockets), this way you can have **multiple layouts on the same PCB**. This also works for other **particular layouts** with split backspace, split left shift, etc.

My recommendation is to **go for an ANSI layout** if you're a beginner. Even if you're used to the ISO layout, the transition is easy and you'll have more options for the PCBs (and for the boards), and later for the keycaps.

---
***TLDR; üè∑Ô∏è*** **ANSI** layout = **US**. **ISO** layout = **EU**. **Go for ANSI** if you're a beginner, you'll have more options for everything.

*Some sizes of keyboards ([YouTube video of Hardware Canucks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWYxofVGIB0))*

#### 65% - 75%

Now we'll be talking about the **size** of the keyboard. Note that sometimes the size can affect the layout.

**65%** and **75%** keyboards are in the most common sizes you'll find (maybe with 60%). They are also the sizes I recommend if you're a beginner. They are **compact** but you'll have everything you need without making compromises.

- 65%: you **get rid** of the **F-row** (F1-F12) and the **numpad**. The **arrow keys** are integrated under the right shift key. This layout is the **most common in the hobby** and the perfect compromise between **compactness** and **functionality**.
- 75%: you **get rid** of the **numpad** but you keep the **F-row**. The **arrow keys** are integrated under the right shift key. This layout is also very common and it's perfect if you want to keep the F-row. Although, the keyboard will be bigger of course.

### Tools

You can get a basic toolkit for around 20‚Ç¨. You can find a lot of options on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=keyboard+toolkit&__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&ref=nb_sb_noss_2). You'll eventually need a screwdriver for screw-in stabilizers, but for the keeb itself most of the time the necessary tools to screw/unscrew the case/plate are included. The [wowstick](https://www.amazon.com/Tournevis-%C3%A9lectrique-Wowstick-tournevis-lithium-ion/dp/B07H27G9NF?th=1) is a really popular choice if you want to get a decent electric screwdriver.
